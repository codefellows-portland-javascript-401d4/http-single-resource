# HTTP single resource server with persistence

## Description

This HTTP server performs CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations on 
different resource types. Resource types could be, for example, notes, 
dogs, cats, cars, etc. The resource type is specified as the first part 
of the URL path, and specific resources may be referred to by passing 
them in the second part of the URL path. A resource can be any JSON object
as long as it has the property "id" that will be used to refer to the 
stored object for updating, retrieval, or deleting.

## Motivation

This was written as a lab assignment for Code Fellows 401 class. The 
code was refactored to generalize data storage for arbitrary object types, 
as well as to make it more modular so it's easier to grow and maintain.

## API Reference

`GET http://<hostname>/notes` returns all notes resources as JSON objects

`GET http://<hostname>/notes/:id` returns the note at a specific id as JSON

`POST http://<hostname>/cats` with a cat object (as JSON) stored on the message body stores 
the cat object at its specified id. A cat object might be in the form 
{ id: "cat1", name: "Garfield", breed: "Tabby" }.

`PUT http://<hostname>/dog/:id` with content (as JSON) stored on the message body replaces 
the content of the dog object at id. New content for an existing dog object 
{ id: "dog2", name: "Shadow", breed: "Australian Shepard" } might be in the form 
{ breed: "Flat-Coated Retriever" }.

`DELETE http://<hostname>/car/:id` removes the car object at id from the server.

## Tests

The accompanying test suite can be run using the 'npm test' command.
